\# EXECUTION LIMITS

This document defines the boundaries execution may not exceed.

Limits are enforced continuously during execution.

\---

\#\# Time Limits

Execution may be bounded by:  
\- Maximum duration  
\- Maximum idle time  
\- Time-to-completion thresholds

Execution exceeding time limits must halt.

\---

\#\# Scope Limits

Execution scope is limited to:  
\- Authorized artifacts  
\- Declared execution context  
\- Approved operational boundaries

Execution may not expand scope dynamically.

\---

\#\# Resource Limits

Execution may be limited by:  
\- Compute usage  
\- Memory allocation  
\- Concurrent operations

Exceeding resource limits invalidates execution.

\---

\#\# Retry Limits

Execution attempts are finite.

Retry eligibility and ceilings are governed by recovery protocols.  
Execution rules do not grant retries.
