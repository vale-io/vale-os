\# IMMUTABLES — INDEX

This directory defines the non-negotiable foundations of the V.A.L.E system.

Immutables are absolute.  
They are not configurable, contextual, conditional, or authority-bound.

Immutables override:  
\- Workflow  
\- Authority  
\- Lifecycle state  
\- Execution logic  
\- Promotion outcomes  
\- System convenience

If an immutable is violated, the system is not misaligned.  
The system is invalid.

No layer of V.A.L.E may bypass, reinterpret, suspend, or soften an immutable.  
No authority may grant an exception.  
No lifecycle phase may defer enforcement.

This directory is the final reference for what cannot change.

Only the following files may exist in this directory:  
\- CANON\_IMMUTABLES.md  
\- SYSTEM\_IMMUTABLES.md  
\- VIOLATION\_CONSEQUENCES.md

Any attempt to declare immutability outside this directory is void.
