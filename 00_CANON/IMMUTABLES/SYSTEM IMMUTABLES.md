\# SYSTEM — IMMUTABLES

These immutables govern system behavior.  
They apply at all times, in all states, without exception.

\---

\#\# 1\. Lifecycle Enforcement

All artifacts must pass through the defined lifecycle.

No artifact may:  
\- Skip a lifecycle phase  
\- Be promoted without review  
\- Be executed without intake  
\- Be archived without trace

If lifecycle order is violated, the artifact is invalid.

\---

\#\# 2\. Authority Containment

Authority is bounded.

No role may:  
\- Grant itself additional authority  
\- Bypass required approvals  
\- Override lifecycle requirements  
\- Alter canon or immutables

Any attempt at authority escalation invalidates the action.

\---

\#\# 3\. Execution Dependency

Execution depends on validation.

No execution may occur unless:  
\- Canon is satisfied  
\- Lifecycle state is valid  
\- Required approvals are present  
\- Halt conditions are clear

Execution without validation is invalid, regardless of outcome.

\---

\#\# 4\. Promotion Gating

Promotion is irreversible without archive.

No artifact may be promoted unless:  
\- It has passed review  
\- It has a recorded decision  
\- It has an audit trace

Once promoted, reversal requires archival.  
Silent rollback is forbidden.

\---

\#\# 5\. Audit Non-Bypass

Audit is mandatory.

No system action may:  
\- Suppress audit logging  
\- Modify audit records  
\- Execute without traceability

An action without audit trace is treated as non-existent.

\---

\#\# 6\. Failure Transparency

Failure must be explicit.

Silent failure, partial execution, or hidden degradation  
are not valid system states.

If execution cannot proceed correctly, the system must halt.

\---

\#\# 7\. Recovery Boundaries

Recovery restores state, not truth.

Recovery may:  
\- Restore previous valid states  
\- Re-run validated processes

Recovery may not:  
\- Rewrite history  
\- Alter audit records  
\- Override canon or immutables

\---

\#\# 8\. System Identity Continuity

System identity is preserved through enforcement.

A system that allows bypass, silent override, or untraceable action  
is no longer operating as V.A.L.E.
