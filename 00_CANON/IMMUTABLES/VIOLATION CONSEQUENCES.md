\# VIOLATION — CONSEQUENCES

This document defines the outcomes of immutable violations within V.A.L.E.

Consequences are automatic.  
They do not require approval, interpretation, or discretion.

\---

\#\# 1\. Canon Violation

If canon is contradicted:  
\- Execution is invalid  
\- Output is void  
\- Promotion is blocked  
\- The system must halt the action

No remediation may proceed until canon alignment is restored.

\---

\#\# 2\. Lifecycle Violation

If lifecycle order is violated:  
\- The artifact is invalid  
\- Promotion is denied  
\- Execution is blocked  
\- An audit record is required

The artifact must re-enter the lifecycle at the last valid state or be archived.

\---

\#\# 3\. Authority Violation

If authority boundaries are breached:  
\- The action is void  
\- The escalation is denied  
\- The attempt is recorded  
\- Future actions by the same authority are flagged

Authority does not gain precedence through violation.

\---

\#\# 4\. Execution Without Validation

If execution occurs without required validation:  
\- Results are discarded  
\- Side effects are quarantined  
\- Recovery is required before continuation

Successful outcomes do not legitimize invalid execution.

\---

\#\# 5\. Audit Violation

If audit trace is missing or altered:  
\- The action is treated as non-existent  
\- Promotion is revoked  
\- Recovery is blocked until traceability is restored

Unaudited actions cannot be legitimized retroactively.

\---

\#\# 6\. Silent Failure

If failure is silent or obscured:  
\- The system must halt  
\- State is marked degraded  
\- Execution is suspended

Normal operation may not resume without explicit resolution.

\---

\#\# 7\. Immutable Override Attempt

If an immutable is bypassed, suspended, or softened:  
\- The system is invalid  
\- Execution must stop  
\- Human intervention is required

There is no automated recovery from immutable override.

\---

\#\# 8\. Identity Breach

If system identity is compromised:  
\- V.A.L.E designation is revoked  
\- Outputs are not canonical  
\- Continuation is prohibited

Restoration requires full revalidation.
