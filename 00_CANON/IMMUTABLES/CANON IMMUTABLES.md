\# CANON — IMMUTABLES

Canon defines meaning.  
Meaning precedes system behavior.

The following statements are immutable within V.A.L.E.

\---

\#\# 1\. Canon Precedence

Canon is upstream of all system behavior.

No execution, automation, workflow, or output may contradict canon.  
If a contradiction occurs, the execution is invalid.

\---

\#\# 2\. Definition Supremacy

Definitions declared in canon override all interpretations.

No implementation, usage pattern, or contextual interpretation may redefine a canonical term.  
If ambiguity exists, canon resolves it.  
If canon is silent, the system must halt rather than infer.

\---

\#\# 3\. Non-Retroactivity

Canon cannot be altered retroactively.

Once an artifact, decision, or system state is produced under a given canon,  
future changes to canon do not rewrite past validity.

Historical artifacts remain evaluated against the canon in force at their time of creation.

\---

\#\# 4\. Canonical Authority Isolation

Canon cannot be modified by:  
\- Execution results  
\- Audit outcomes  
\- Authority escalation  
\- System optimization  
\- External pressure

Only explicit, intentional canon revision may alter canon.  
All revisions are forward-only.

\---

\#\# 5\. Canon Over Convenience

System convenience does not justify canon deviation.

If canon compliance conflicts with:  
\- Speed  
\- Performance  
\- Automation  
\- Usability  
\- Business pressure

Canon compliance prevails.

\---

\#\# 6\. Canon Silence Rule

Silence in canon is not permission.

If canon does not define a concept, behavior, or term,  
the system must not assume, extrapolate, or fabricate meaning.

The correct response to canonical silence is suspension or escalation,  
not inference.

\---

\#\# 7\. Canon Identity Lock

The identity of the system is bound to canon.

If canon is removed, corrupted, or bypassed,  
the system ceases to be V.A.L.E.
